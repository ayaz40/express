# Ayaz small Project

# Description
This is a basic web application built using Express.js, EJS templating, and Node.js. It serves as a minimal example to demonstrate the usage of key components and features in a web application.

## Features
Express.js Framework: The project is built on top of the Express.js web framework, making it easy to create robust and efficient web applications.

EJS Templating: EJS (Embedded JavaScript) is used as the templating engine to dynamically generate HTML content and render views.

Static Assets: Static assets like CSS styles and images are served using Express middleware, allowing for organized structuring of assets.

Environmental Variables: The project utilizes the dotenv library to manage environment variables, ensuring secure configuration management.

Modular Routing: Routes are organized into a separate folder (routes/all.js) to keep the codebase clean and maintainable.
